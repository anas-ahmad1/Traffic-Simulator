# Traffic-Simulator
"Traffic Simulator" is a C++ project utilizing a simple graphics library to create a realistic simulation of traffic at a crossroad where four roads intersect. The simulation includes traffic signals that control the flow of vehicles through the intersection, providing a safe and orderly traffic management experience.

**Features:**

* **Traffic Intersection:** Simulate a crossroad where four roads converge, creating a complex traffic management scenario.
* **Traffic Signal Control:** Implement traffic signals at the intersection, each with a fixed timer for changing signal states.
* **Signal States:** The traffic signals alternate between red and green states. When one signal is green, the other three are red, ensuring vehicles move safely through the intersection.
* **Countdown Timer:** While a signal is red, it displays a countdown timer indicating the time remaining until it turns green. This information helps drivers and pedestrians anticipate when they can proceed.
